# Get Average
#
# Write a program that takes an array, and prints the AVERAGE of the values in the array. For example for an array [2, 10, 3], your program should print an average of 5. Again, make sure you come up with a simple base case and write instructions to solve that base case first, then test your instructions for other complicated cases. You can use a count function with this assignment.
sum = 0

# newnum = 0
for i in 0..255
  # puts "New number: #{i} "
  # i=newnum
  sum=sum+i
  # puts "Sum: #{sum}"
end
x = [1, 5, 987, -98, 41]

for i in x
