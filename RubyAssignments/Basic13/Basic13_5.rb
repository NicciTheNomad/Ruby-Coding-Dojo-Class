# Find Max
#
# Write a program (sets of instructions) that takes any array and prints the maximum value in the array. Your program should also work with a given array that has all negative numbers (e.g. [-3, -5, -7]), or even a mix of positive numbers, negative numbers and zero.
x = [7, -3, 10, 0, -3]
y = [7, 55, 210, 0, 53]
z = [-87, -3, -0.10, 0, -8]

puts "The lowest number of range x is " + x.min.to_s + " and the highest number is " + x.max.to_s

puts "The lowest number of range y is " + y.min.to_s + " and the highest number is " + y.max.to_s

puts "The lowest number of range z is " + z.min.to_s + " and the highest number is " + z.max.to_s
